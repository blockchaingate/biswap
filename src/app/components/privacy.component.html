    </p>
    <br>
    <b>Where we store your personal data</b>
    <p>
        Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers and business partners store and

    <br>
    <b>Transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK)K</b>
    <p>
        We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA and UK to other Company subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (i.e Data Processors) who are engaged on our behalf. To the extent that we transfer your personal information outside

        By using our products and services, you consent to your Personal Data being transferred to other countries, including countries that have differing levels of privacy and data protection laws than your country. In all such transfers, we will protect your

    <br>
    <b>Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains</b>
    <p>
        Your funding of bitcoin, ether, FAB, EXG, BST and other Digital Assets, may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains
        are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.
        <br> Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Exchangily LLC or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data from such networks.
    </p>
    <br>
    <B>Data Retention</B>
    <p>
        Safeguarding the privacy of your personal information is of utmost importance to us, whether you interact with us personally, by phone, by email, over the internet or any other electronic medium. We will hold personal information, for as long as we have
        a business relationship with you, in secure computer storage facilities, and we take the necessary measures to protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
        <br> When we consider that personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, we will remove any details that will identify you or we will securely destroy the records. However, we may need to maintain records
        for a significant period of time (after you cease being our client). For example, we are subject to certain anti-money laundering laws which require us to retain the following, for a period of 5 years after our business relationship with you has
        ended.
        <br> A copy of the records we used in order to comply with our client due diligence obligations;
        <br> Supporting evidence and records of transactions with you and your relationship with us.
        <br> Also, the personal information we hold in the form of a recorded information, by telephone, electronically or otherwise, will be held in line with local regulatory requirements (i.e. 5 years after our business relationship with you has ended
        or longer if you have legitimate interests (such as handling a dispute with you)). If you have opted out of receiving marketing communications we will hold your details on our suppression list so that we know you do not want to receive these communications.
        <br> We may keep your data for longer than 5 years if we cannot delete if for legal, regulatory or technical reasons.
